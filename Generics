Generics

Things you can do with a generic class or interface

* Create an instance of a generified class.
val duckList: MutableList<Duck>
duckList = mutableListOf(Duck("Donald"), Duck("Daisy"), Duck("Daffy"))
val list = mutableListOf("Fee", "Fi", "Fum")

* Create a function that takes a generic type.
fun quack(ducks: MutableList<Duck>) {
  //Code to make the Ducks quack
}

* Create a function that returns a generic type.
fun getDucks(breed: String): MutableList<Duck> {
//Code to get Ducks for the specified breed
}

Covariant: 

-If a generic type is covariant, it means that you can use a subtype in place of a supertype.
-When we prefix a generic type with out, we say that the generic type is covariant. In other words, it means that a subtype can be used in place of a supertype.


-In general, a class or interface generic type may be prefixed with out if the class has functions that use it as a return type, or if the class has val properties of that type. You can’t, however, use out if the class has function parameters or var properties of that generic type.

Note - Another way of thinking about this is that a generic type that’s prefixed with out can only be used in an “out” position, such as a function return type. It can’t, however, be used in an “in” position, so a function can’t receive a covariant type as a parameter value.

Contravariant
-------

- If a generic type is contravariant, it means that you can use a supertype in place of a subtype. This is the opposite of covariance.

- When we prefix a generic type with in, we say that the generic type is contravariant. In other words, it means that a supertype can be used in place of a subtype.

Note: In other words, a generic type that’s prefixed with “in” can only be used in an “in” position, such as a function parameter value. It can’t be used in “out” positions.

Invariant
--------
- When a generic type has no in or out prefix, we say that the type is invariant. An invariant type can only accept references of that specific type.


Bullet Point
Generics let you write consistent code that’s type-safe. Collections such as MutableList use generics.

The generic type is defined inside angle brackets <>, for example:

class Contest<T>
You can restrict the generic type to a specific supertype, for example:

class Contest<T: Pet>
You create an instance of a class with a generic type by specifying the “real” type in angle brackets, for example:

Contest<Cat>
Where possible, the compiler will infer the generic type.

You can define a function that uses a generic type outside a class declaration, or one that uses a different generic type, for example:

fun <T> listPet(): List<T>{

    ...

}
A generic type is invariant if it can only accept references of that specific type. Generic types are invariant by default.

A generic type is covariant if you can use a subtype in place of a supertype. You specify that a type is covariant by prefixing it with out.

A generic type is contravariant if you can use a supertype in place of a subtype. You specify that a type is contravariant by prefixing it with in.
