Exception Classes

- All exception classes in Kotlin inherit the Throwable class
- Kotlin does not have checked the exception(These are the exceptions that are checked at compile time. If some code within a method throws a checked exception IOException, SQLException, etc)
let's say IO operation 
           try {
               log.append(message)
               }  catch (IOException e) {
                //Must be safe
               }
And that's not good. Just take a look at Effective java: Don't ignore  exception
- The throw expression has the type Nothing. This type has no value and is used to mark code location that can never be reached.
