Infix notation

- Functions marked with the infix keyword can also be called using the infix notation (omitting the dot and the parentheses for the call). Infix functions must meet the following requirements:

   1. They must be member functions or extension functions.
   2. They must have a single parameter.
   3. The parameter must not accept variable number of arguments and must have no default value.

- Note that infix functions always require both the receiver and the parameter to be specified. When you're calling a method on the current receiver using the infix notation, use this explicitly. This is required to ensure unambiguous parsing.
